TakeCommand's installer creates a shortcut on the desktop in the Sandbox.

The default shortcut contains a disappointing path the TC installation directory where no user wants to be.

Improve usability by deleting the content of the "Start in" property. This will land you on the desktop.
Improve it even more by changing it to "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\Shared".
